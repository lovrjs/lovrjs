# Contributing to Carmel Starter Kit Samples

These examples are provided as-is and are updated to present best practices
for programming WebVR experiences against Carmel and other browsers.

## Our Development Process

Our examples are copied from an internal repository which is tracking the
latest versions of the WebVR API. As new versions of the API become stable
we transfer our internal samples to this repository.

## Pull Requests

We generally don't expect to take pull requests and instead prefer to take
community feedback through issues. Each issue will be evaluated for changes
in our internal repository.

If you feel that submitting a pull request best demonstrates your issue then
we will do our best to transfer your intent to our internal repository and
push it back to the public repository.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you haven't already, complete the Contributor License Agreement ("CLA").
